	\paragraph{Brief recap \thenum.}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item PMFs are usually more intuitive to retrieve for discrete rvs, whereas CDFs are more intuitive for continuous rvs.
		\item For a PMF to be valid, it needs to satisfy two requirements, $p(e)\geq 0$ for any event, and $\sum_{i\in E} = 1$, where $E$ is the sample space.
		\item For a PDFs $f$ to be valid, it needs to satisfy three requirements, $f\geq 0$ for any event, $f$ is piecewise continuous, and $\int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x)dx = 1$, where $E$ is the sample space. 
		\item 
	\end{enumerate}
	\paragraph{Exercise \thenum.}
	Consider a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials, each with the same success probability $p \in [0, 1]$, with trials performed until a success occurs. Let $X$ be the number of failures before the first successful trial. 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Determine $P (X = k)$.
		\item Show that it is a valid PMF.
		\item Calculate $E[X]$.
	\end{enumerate}
	This distribution is called the geometric distribution $X\sim {\rm Geom}(p)$.
	\stepcounter{num} 
	\paragraph{Exercise \thenum.}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Show that $p(n) = ( 1/2)^{n+1}$ for $n = 0, 1, 2,\ldots$ is a valid PMF for a discrete r.v.
		\item  Find the CDF of a random variable with the PMF in 1.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\stepcounter{num} 
	\paragraph{Exercise \thenum.}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Benford's law states that in a very large variety of real-life data sets, the first digit approximately follows a particular distribution with about a 30\% chance of a 1, an 18\% chance of a 2, and in general
		$$
		P(D = j) = {\rm log}_{10}\left(\frac{j+1}{j}\right),\quad  \forall j \in \{1, 2, 3,\ldots, 9\}.
		$$ 
		where $D$ is the first digit of a randomly chosen element. Check that this is a valid PMF.
	\end{enumerate}

	\paragraph{Exercise \thenum.}
	Let $X \sim {\rm Bin}(n, p)$ and $Y \sim {\rm Bin}(m, p)$, independent of $X$.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item  Show that $X+Y$ is Binomial and give its distribution.
	\item  Is $X-Y$ Binomial? If yes, give its distribution. If not, why?
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\stepcounter{num} 
	\paragraph{Exercise \thenum.}
	There are two coins, one with probability $p_1$ of Heads and the other with probability $p_2$ of Heads. 
	One of the coins is randomly chosen (with equal probabilities for the two coins). 
	It is then flipped $n \geq 2$ times. 
	Let X be the number of times it lands Heads.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Find the PMF of $X$.
		\item What is the distribution of $X$ if $p_1 = p_2$?
		\end{enumerate}
	
	
	
	\stepcounter{num} 
	\paragraph{Exercise \thenum.}
	Student A flips a fair coin \(n\) times and student B flips another fair coin \(n+1\) times, resulting in independent random variables \( X \sim \text{Bin}(n, \frac{1}{2}) \) and \( Y \sim \text{Bin}(n+1, \frac{1}{2}) \).
	
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Show that \( P(X < Y) = P(n - X < n + 1 - Y) \).
	
	\item Compute \( P(X < Y) \).
	\end{enumerate}

	\paragraph{Exercise \thenum.}
	Let $X$ be a non-negative rv and $a>0$ be some fixed number. 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Show that a $\mathbb I _{|X|\geq a} \leq X$, where $\mathbb I $ is the indicator rv.
		\item Prove the Markov inequality using the previous result.
	\end{enumerate}

	\paragraph{Exercise \thenum.}
	Let \( X \) be the number of purchases that Fred will make on the online site for a certain company (in some specified time period). Suppose that the probability mass function (PMF) of \( X \) is
	
	\[
	P(X = k) = \frac{e^{-\lambda} \lambda^k}{k!}, \quad k = 0, 1, 2, \dots
	\]
	
	This distribution is called the Poisson distribution with parameter \( \lambda \), and it will be studied extensively in later chapters.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Find \( P(X \geq 1) \) and \( P(X \geq 2) \) using 2 different methods.
		
		\item Suppose that the company only knows about people who have made at least one purchase on their site (a user sets up an account to make a purchase, but someone who has never made a purchase there doesn?t appear in the customer database). If the company computes the number of purchases for everyone in their database, then these data are draws from the conditional distribution of the number of purchases, given that at least one purchase is made. Find the conditional PMF of \( X \) given \( X \geq 1 \). (This conditional distribution is called a truncated Poisson distribution.)
	\end{enumerate}
	
	
	\stepcounter{num} 
	\paragraph{Exercise \thenum.}
	In a national survey, a random sample of people are chosen and asked whether they support a certain policy. 
	Assume that everyone in the population is equally likely to
	be surveyed at each step, and that the sampling is with replacement.
	Let n be the sample size, and let $\hat p$ and $p$ be the proportion of people who support the policy in the sample
	and in the entire population, respectively. 
	Show that
	\begin{equation}
		\forall c>0, \quad P(|\hat p - p|>c) \leq \frac{1}{4nc^2}.
	\end{equation}
	
	\stepcounter{num} 
	\paragraph{Exercise \thenum.}
	For i.i.d. r.v.s $X_1,\ldots , X_n$ with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$, give a value of $n$ that will ensure that there is at least a 99\% chance that the sample mean will
	be within 2 standard deviations of the true mean $\mu$.
	
	
	\stepcounter{num} 
	\paragraph{Exercise \thenum.}
	Let $X_1, X_2,\ldots$ be i.i.d. positive random variables with mean 2. 
	Let $Y_1, Y_2,\ldots$ be i.i.d. positive random variables with mean 3. 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Show that
		$$
		\frac{X_1+X_2+\ldots+X_n}{Y_1+Y_2+\ldots+Y_n}\rightarrow \frac{2}{3}
		$$
		with probability 1. 
		Does it matter whether the $X_i$ are independent of the $Y_j$ ?
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\stepcounter{num} 
	\paragraph{Exercise \thenum.}
	Let $Y_1, Y_2,\ldots, U_{100}$ be i.i.d. r.v.s with distribution  ${\rm Unif}(0,1)$ and $X = Y_1 + Y_2 + \ldots + U_{100}$.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Which important distribution is the distribution of X very close to? Specify what
		the parameters are, and state which theorem justifies your choice.
		\item Give a simple but accurate approximation for $P(X > 17)$. Justify briefly.
	\end{enumerate}
